# Pantry Organiser and Meal Planner

This app is still work in progress. 
It will server as a weekly meal planner, a pantry stock storage and a suggestion listing. 
The primary goal for this app is to avoid food wastage by using items listed in the pantry to suggest meals saved to your account with products you already have or will need to purchase. Therefore aiding in reusing as much produce as possible saving you both money and the need to throw food away.
